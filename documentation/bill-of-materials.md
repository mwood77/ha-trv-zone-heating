# Bill of Materials & Cost

This page contains links to purchase the products required to make this suite of automations work.

> [!NOTE]
> The following tables contains affiliate links to Amazon and Aliexpress; **you do not pay an inflated price because of this.** Should you decide to use another supplier, please ensure that you cross-reference this table and buy functionally identical components. 
>
> While most of these components are standardized, I will not be able to assist you if you purchase your components from different suppliers or manufacturers.
>
> You can cross-reference what (sensors) each device exposes using [Zigbee2MQTT's fantastic device database](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/).

## Purchase links by geographic region:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I've included a central thermostat within the parts list, which is the single largest expense in the project. If your existing thermostat is remote-controllable and not closed source (you can control it over the internet or locally via an API), then you don't need to purchase one.
> 
> Some common reliable options include:
> - Google Nest Learning Thermostat (via Google Cloud - my recommendation)
> - Ecobee (via HomeKit)
> - Honeywell T6 (via HomeKit)
> - Honeywell T9 (via HomeKit)
